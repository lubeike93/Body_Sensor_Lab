Course Description:

Content:

In this lab a simple sensor network is built using an external accelerometer sensor and internal sensors of modern smartphones. Goal is to determine the physical activity, e.g. "walking", "running", "jumping", "cycling", based on accelerometer data. The algorithms are developed within Matlab/Simulink and used through automatic code generation for Android. Additionally a graphical user interface (GUI) has to be implemented in Java.

Goal:

+ Hands-on experience in team-work (cooperation, project-/time planning, etc.)
+ Java-based programming of modern smartphones (Android)
+ High-Level programming and automatic code generation with Matlab/Simulink
+ Algorithms for physical activity recognition
